🕴️ Why did I built it?
 
 - While searching for a javascript project idea which i can built from the ground up,
   I encountered countless pomodoro apps and I decided to add one myself 🙃. The main objective
   was to create a responsive, visualy appealing minimal app that is not distracting to look at.
